# Selecting data from Málaga Parking

Using as input data the state of [Málaga car parks in real-time](https://datosabiertos.malaga.eu/recursos/aparcamientos/ocupappublicosmun/ocupappublicosmun.csv), develop a PySpark application that selects the data of each car park only when the parking has a capacity higher than zero. The result must be only "updated” when new data are showing up.

**Hint**:  use this [script](https://ensenanzaspropias.cv.uma.es/mod/resource/view.php?id=289843) for downloading the CSVs). (Requires logging in the university Campus Virtual).

The outcoming data frames must contain the following fields: **name**, **capacity** and number of available slots (**free slots**).

  

  

The deliverable of the task will be a zip file containing the programa, the data file and a screen capture of the program output (the part printing the fields)
