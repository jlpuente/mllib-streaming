# Classsification and Wine dataset from UCI

Write a Spark (Java or Python) application that uses a machine learning algorithm included in Spark to train and test a model (with a ratio 75 %-25 %) using as input data the  [Wine Data set from the UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine).  

The orignal data must be properly preprocessed using only SparkML features (i.e., Pandas is not allowed).

The deliverable of the task will be a ZIP file containing the program, the data file and a screen capture of the program output (the part printing the accuracy value).
