# Calculating the highest temperature from sensors each 20 seconds window

Using the data produced by the TemperatureSensorWithTimeStamp.py, write a PySpark application that finds the highest temperature each 20 seconds, grouping by sensor (at least 2).

The deliverable of the task will be a ZIP file containing the program, the data file and a screen capture of the program output (the part printing the highest value by sensor).
