# Performance on multicore processors of a Spark ML classifier

Select two data files you find interesting from the  [LIBSVM repository](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/)  and use the Spark ML support vector machine algorithm in Java and Python to measure its performance in terms of computing time using 1, 2, 4 and 8 cores. Report the times obtained and analyze them.
