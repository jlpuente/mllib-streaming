# Random forest

Write a Spark (Java or Python) application that uses the  [random forest](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.5/ml-classification-regression.html#random-forest-classifier) implementation of Spark to train and test a model (with a ratio 75 %-25 %) using a data file in libsvm format. The program must prints as output the value of the accuracy metric. The data file to use is the breast-cancer-scale file that can be found in this  [link](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#breast-cancer).  

The deliverable of the task will be a ZIP file containing the program, the data file and a screen capture of the program output (the part printing the accuracy value).
